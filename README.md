# ETL Data Automation using Airflow, MySQL, and PostgreSQL

This project demonstrates an automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract data from MySQL, load it into PostgreSQL, perform data aggregation, and send the results via email. The process is scheduled to run daily at specific times to ensure the most recent data is available for analysis.

## Project Overview
The project automates the ETL process using Apache Airflow to extract data from a MySQL database and load it into a PostgreSQL staging area in Parquet format. The data is then aggregated, and a daily report is generated and emailed. The goal is to streamline data processing, enable automated reporting, and ensure that the latest data is always available for analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Automated ETL process scheduled to run daily at 7 AM.
- Aggregated data is stored in PostgreSQL and saved in Parquet format for staging.
- A separate DAG triggers at 9 AM to send the daily report via email.
- Three DAGs are involved: 
  - ETL DAG
  - Aggregation DAG
  - Report Generation DAG

## Problem Statement
The main challenge addressed by this project is automating the daily transfer of data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, ensuring the availability of the latest data for analysis and sending automated reports at a scheduled time.

**Objectives:**
- Schedule an automated ETL process using Airflow to extract data at 7 AM daily.
- Load the extracted data into PostgreSQL in Parquet format and aggregate it.
- Send a report via email at 9 AM based on the aggregated data.

## Data Pipeline Architecture
The ETL process consists of three DAGs that handle different stages of the pipeline:
1. **ETL DAG**: Extracts data from MySQL and loads it into PostgreSQL.
2. **Aggregation DAG**: Aggregates the data for key metrics such as sales, quantity, and profit.
3. **Report DAG**: Sends the daily report via email containing the aggregated metrics.

### Data Flow Diagram

## Data Understanding
The project uses a **Store Sales Forecasting** dataset. The data includes the following attributes:
- **Sales**: Total sales amount for each transaction.
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold.
- **Discount**: Discount applied to the sales.
- **Profit**: Total profit generated.

Data is extracted from a MySQL table and transformed before being loaded into PostgreSQL for further analysis.

## ETL Process
- **Extract**: Data is extracted from the MySQL `stores_sales_forecasting` table.
- **Transform**: Data is saved in Parquet format in the staging area for efficient processing and storage.
- **Load**: The data is loaded into PostgreSQL for further aggregation and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestration tool for scheduling and automating the ETL process.
- **MySQL**: Source database for extracting data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Destination database for storing and aggregating data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Parquet**: Data format used for staging in PostgreSQL.

## Usage
1. **Setup the environment**: Make sure to have Apache Airflow, MySQL, and PostgreSQL running. You can configure Airflow with Docker.
2. **DAGs**: Include the three DAGs in the `dags` folder of your Airflow setup:
   - `final_etl_dag.py`
   - `final_aggregation_dag.py`
   - `final_report_dag.py`
3. **Trigger the DAGs**: The DAGs will run automatically as per the schedule, or you can trigger them manually via the Airflow UI.
4. **Email Configuration**: Ensure that SMTP is configured in Airflow to send reports via email.

### Sample Commands
- Start Airflow:
  ```bash
  airflow scheduler
  airflow webserver
  ```
- View DAGs:
  Visit the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` to manage and monitor DAGs.

## Conclusion
This project automates the ETL process for transferring data from MySQL to PostgreSQL and provides daily automated reports based on the latest data. It helps reduce manual workload and ensures consistent and timely reporting.

## Future Improvements
- **Monitoring**: Implement a monitoring system for tracking the success or failure of each DAG run.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to ensure data integrity.
- **Scaling**: Optimize the pipeline for handling larger datasets.
